/// `ByteBuffer` stores contiguously allocated raw bytes. It is a random and sequential accessible sequence of zero or
/// more bytes (octets).
///
/// ### Allocation
/// Use `allocator.buffer(capacity: desiredCapacity)` to allocate a new `ByteBuffer`.
///
/// ### Supported types
/// A variety of types can be read/written from/to a `ByteBuffer`. Using Swift's `extension` mechanism you can easily
/// create `ByteBuffer` support for your own data types. Out of the box, `ByteBuffer` supports for example the following
/// types (non-exhaustive list):
///
///  - `String`/`StaticString`
///  - Swift's various (unsigned) integer types
///  - `Foundation`'s `Data`
///  - `[UInt8]` and generally any `Collection` of `UInt8`
///
/// ### Random Access
/// For every supported type `ByteBuffer` usually contains two methods for random access:
///
///  1. `get<Type>(at: Int, length: Int)` where `<type>` is for example `String`, `Data`, `Bytes` (for `[UInt8]`)
///  2. `set<Type>(at: Int)`
///
/// Example:
///
///     var buf = ...
///     buf.setString("Hello World", at: 0)
///     buf.moveWriterIndex(to: 11)
///     let helloWorld = buf.getString(at: 0, length: 11)
///
///     let written = buf.setInteger(17 as Int, at: 11)
///     buf.moveWriterIndex(forwardBy: written)
///     let seventeen: Int? = buf.getInteger(at: 11)
///
/// If needed, `ByteBuffer` will automatically resize its storage to accommodate your `set` request.
///
/// ### Sequential Access
/// `ByteBuffer` provides two properties which are indices into the `ByteBuffer` to support sequential access:
///  - `readerIndex`, the index of the next readable byte
///  - `writerIndex`, the index of the next byte to write
///
/// For every supported type `ByteBuffer` usually contains two methods for sequential access:
///
///  1. `read<Type>(length: Int)` to read `length` bytes from the current `readerIndex` (and then advance the reader
///     index by `length` bytes)
///  2. `write<Type>(Type)` to write, advancing the `writerIndex` by the appropriate amount
///
/// Example:
///
///      var buf = ...
///      buf.writeString("Hello World")
///      buf.writeInteger(17 as Int)
///      let helloWorld = buf.readString(length: 11)
///      let seventeen: Int = buf.readInteger()
///
/// ### Layout
///     +-------------------+------------------+------------------+
///     | discardable bytes |  readable bytes  |  writable bytes  |
///     |                   |     (CONTENT)    |                  |
///     +-------------------+------------------+------------------+
///     |                   |                  |                  |
///     0      <=      readerIndex   <=   writerIndex    <=    capacity
///
/// The 'discardable bytes' are usually bytes that have already been read, they can however still be accessed using
/// the random access methods. 'Readable bytes' are the bytes currently available to be read using the sequential
/// access interface (`read<Type>`/`write<Type>`). Getting `writableBytes` (bytes beyond the writer index) is undefined
/// behaviour and might yield arbitrary bytes (_not_ `0` initialised).
///
/// ### Slicing
/// `ByteBuffer` supports slicing a `ByteBuffer` without copying the underlying storage.
///
/// Example:
///
///     var buf = ...
///     let dataBytes: [UInt8] = [0xca, 0xfe, 0xba, 0xbe]
///     let dataBytesLength = UInt32(dataBytes.count)
///     buf.writeInteger(dataBytesLength) /* the header */
///     buf.writeBytes(dataBytes) /* the data */
///     let bufDataBytesOnly = buf.getSlice(at: 4, length: dataBytes.count)
///     /* `bufDataByteOnly` and `buf` will share their storage */
///
/// ### Notes
/// All `ByteBuffer` methods that don't contain the word 'unsafe' will only allow you to access the 'readable bytes'.
///
